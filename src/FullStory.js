          <p className='story__grid--text'>From a very young age I was obsessed with building things. I loved Legos, Duplos, Bionicles and many other building/architectirl toys. As I look back on those years with a bit more wisdom on myself I realized I liked those toys but loved the feeling of building or creating my own original ideas. To this day I feel fulfilled and proud of building and creating beautiful products, designs and experiences.</p>
